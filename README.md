# Where's Romo

Me and my friends found ourselves asking this question every week.  For non-NFL fans Tony Romo is an ex-player and new announcer for CBS's national broadcasts.  His insightful and entertaining commentary has taken the football world by storm.

So, one Sunday morning before the games started I decided to make a little site that just displayed which game he was covering and what time it was on.  It served as good practice for responsive design since it would mostly be viewed on different mobile devices.
